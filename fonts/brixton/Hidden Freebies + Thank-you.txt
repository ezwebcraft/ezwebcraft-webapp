If I could personally thank every person that downloaded one of my fonts I really would, but unfortunately that's just not possible. However, I do try my best to show my appreciation with newsletter exclusive free fonts and limited time coupons only for those that subscribe and follow me on this creative entrepreneurial journey.

So, would you do me the honor of subscribing to my newsletter (http://eepurl.com/beQLFL), it's completely free and within a few days you'll receive some great free downloads that I think you will love!

Have a great week!
Tom Chalky
