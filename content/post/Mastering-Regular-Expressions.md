So Linux Academy is offering a great course called Mastering Regular Expressions. After taking a few video course and video, I have to say learning more regular expressions is more important than ever. Perhaps a few regexes (regular expressions) is fine for simple tasks, but for complex problems, having a deeper knowledge on many levels can boost your technical skill to a new level especially with the need for big data. Regex is serving a fundamental tool for the filter, searches analyze and summarize data. In today programming languages its extremely rare for a language to not a regex engine of any kind.
