      <description>About me
I am a Linux engineer by day and a Pythoneer by night. I am an ambitious problem solver with a passion for Unix (Solaris, AIX, OSX) / Linux (Slackware, Redhat, Ubuntu, Centos), development and technology as a whole. I am continually evaluating and upgrading my skills so that I can stay at the cutting edge of IT by studying and taking online courses.</description>
